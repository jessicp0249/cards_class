# cards_class


## Functionality

    The program by default takes in 52 Card objects which are intiliazed to a Deck object. The Deck 
    object is just a vector ranging from 0-51. The functions shuffle() and deal(int n) are the
    main member functions of the Deck class. The shuffle() function utilizes a randomization
    algorithm and the deal() function simply takes in an integer and outputs all the Card objects
    before that integer.
